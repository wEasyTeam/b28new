		<h1>Introducing b28new.js</h1>
		<p> <em>b28new.js</em>
			is a lib that ET.w written for pruduct web pages translation. There has already been a old version named <em title="Butterfat internationalization">b28n.js</em>
			on the Internet written by
			<a title="bmuller@buttterfat.net" href="#">bmuller</a>
			and we refer to it's realization at the first version, so that's why we name this lib with b28new.
		The lib has been proved to be robust and compatible with allmost all the modern browser as well as ie7 &amp; ie8.
		Hope that it's helpful!
		</p>

		<h2>How to Use</h2>
		<section>
			<h3>Import b28new.js to your html files</h3>
			<p>
				First, found a folder to place b28new.js as well as your language files, I create a folder 
			named 'lang' in the same root with the html file to place it. Then import b28new.js to your html files like this:
			</p>
			<pre>&lt;script src="lang/b28new_3.0.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
			<p>
				<em>Note:</em>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Make sure you put b28new.js in the same folder with language files, or you need to modify
						it to ensure loading language files properly.
					</li>
					<li>
						You'd better put b28new.js before all the js that might change the 
					Document incase translate failed.
					</li>
					<li>
						If there is a frame in your translate page, don't set the frame's src 
						until top window's domready to avoid some unexpected errors.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you use ajaxLoad to fill a section, don't forget to translate it use:
						<code>B.translate(section || section.id)</code>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Pick up text in the html and javascript files</h3>
			<p>
				We have a tool name "textPicker" to help you with rough pick up, 
			and you may fix the flaws afterwards. You can find it and a brief readme text in folder "automaticTool".
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, we used to do the pick-up job all by hand, 
			and that's quite funny experience, I was serious.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Do translate</h3>
			<p>
				After you finished pick-up, for the convenience of translators, we suggest that you put all the text that need to be translated in a excel or xml file like this:
			</p>
			<img src="img/JSON.png" title="JSON in Excel" />
			<img src="img/xml_excel.png" title="xml opened in Excel as xml file" />
			<article>
				<p>
					If you want to carrier translation with xml file, format your file like this:
				</p>
				<img src="img/xml.png" title="xml in excel" />
				<p>
					But the xml style is not recommend, for it have to use redundant tags and the speed of translation is slower than JSON style.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p>
					If you want your language packet organized in the form of JSON, you should choose 
				excel(Use Microsoft Excel 2007 or higher version) as carrier of translation, and use language as column title. You can also add an extra column for JSON as "msgid" when you don't want use the translated text itself as translate anchor, then you should have the text wrapped with an element tag and add a data-lang="msgid" attribute on it. We have a automatic tool in perl named "JSONParser" in folder "automaticTool" to parse excel file in JSON format(writen by linguang), but it can only be installed on linux, 
				 you can read the "readme" document to get start. The output file look like this:
				</p>
				<pre class="prettyprint">{"OK":"确定",
"Cancel":"取消",
"Save":"保存"}</pre>
				<p>
					Yes, you can also try it out to arrange the JSON file in this way by hand
				 and share your feelings with us, for we've never done that before. Oh, don't 
				 forget to escape ' " ' and ' \ ' or you won't like to see the translate result.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<p>
					About the text in javascript file, you need to translate them with function "_" 
				like this:
					<code>_('text')</code>
					.
				</p>
			</article>
			<p>
				Put the JSON or xml file in the lang folder. And add a script
				<code>B.setTextDomain(["languagePacketFile1", "languagePacketFile2"], language);</code>
				in the html right after
				<code>&lt;script src="lang/b28new_3.0.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
				.Then try to 
				open your work on browser to see if the translate works.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ok, now you might think it's time to declare mission accomplished, but I have to 
				remind you the tranlation may not be perfect, do take care about the style for translation
				text may be much longer(or shorter) than the before.
			</p>

		<h3>Do it better with b28new</h3>
		<p>We've got some helpful tips for you here:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Use
				<code>B.setTextDomain(["languagePacketFile1", "languagePacketFile2"]);</code>
				without set 
			a definite language, the script will aotomatic set a language for you. Language set in cookie have the 
			highest priority, the cookie name is 'bLanguage'. The navigator language will be consider 
			secondly. And if we don't have cookie named with 'bLanguage' or cookie language as well as navigator 
			language is not in support list, we'll use the default language to show the pages.
			</li>
			<li>
				Configure b28Cfg to customize translate style of your own.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.supportLang = ["en", "cn"]</code>
						: Only language in the support array 
					can be shown in the web pages, make sure you have every supported language translated.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.defaultLang = 'en'</code>
						: The first tip has told about the part
					default language plays.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.fileType = "JSON"</code>
						: Set the file type of translatin pakeges.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.idDefaultLang = true</code>
						: True means you choose to use the text node it self
					as the anchor to match the translation, while false means you add a "data-lang='value'" label
					for every translated node as a translation anchor, and using 'value' to match translation.
					 Only add "data-lang" label to element node and when you do that b28 won't traverse it's childern nodes any more, so be careful with it.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.trimText = true</code>
						: Trim the text-node value before match the translation.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.insertHTML = true</code>
						: Replace the text-node with html text instead of
					plain text, we disabled it by default.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code>b28Cfg.initSelect = true</code>
						: If you want to switch language
					 on the web page, just add a select element with id 'select-lang' and enable this config.
					 You can also use
						<code>B.setLang(language)</code>
						and then reload the page if necessary to change language on your own way.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				If you come across a phrase that have two(or more) meanings in diffrent situation, you can name the secondary meanings with a new name, and add 'data-lang="theNewName"' label where you want the text to be replaced with the another meaning.
				<p>Just like this(I make up them):</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Happiness</dt>
					<dd>A felling of delight</dd>
					<dt>Happiness</dt>
					<dd>A movie name</dd>
				</dl>
			</li>
		</ol>
